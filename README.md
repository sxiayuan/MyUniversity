Project Building Journey
The project was something that Stephanie wanted to built for a long time. After consulting some of her friends, they said this project would help them a lot and that's where it all started
The website was built using HTML (Structure) and CSS (Styling & minimal transitions). This is Stephanie's 3rd website and she has gotten a lot more natural and smoother when she's coding with these languages. She can now effortlessly craft out a draft of her website without needing too much additional help. However, the design of a table is something she has never tried before, and she required help from external sources to help her style and structure it. The research of this project took extremely long. The process of flipping through hundreds of unviersity websites was extremely teditious, but it also helped her develop her research and strategic analysis skills in the process.
