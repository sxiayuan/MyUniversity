        <h4>Important Notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li> What does AEO mean for Western Ivey?:  It is the conditional pre-admission to the Ivey Program. Most students apply to the Ivey program in their 2nd year, but accepting as a AEO student means guaranteeing a spot on the Ivey program in your 3rd year. Applying for the AEO is a seperate decision than your admission to Western.</li>
            <li>None of the schools officially publish program-level acceptance rates for these undergrad business programs. The acceptance rates are estimates.</li>
            <li>Deadlines & fees fluctuate every cycle. Always follow the live OUAC key dates plus each school's admissions portal for the most current information.</li>
            <li>For Ontario students: The OUAC rule is maximum 3 choices at any single Ontario university. UBC lets you pick two degree choices on one application.</li>
